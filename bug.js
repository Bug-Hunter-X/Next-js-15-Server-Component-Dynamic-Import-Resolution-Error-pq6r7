In Next.js 15, an uncommon error arises when using server components with dynamic imports within a route handler.  The issue manifests as a runtime error, often related to the inability to resolve the imported module at runtime, despite it being correctly packaged and present in the output directory. This usually happens when the dynamic import depends on a context or data that's only available at request time within the server component.  For example:

```javascript
// pages/api/route.js (Server Component)
export default async function handler(req, res) {
  const dynamicModule = await import(`./modules/${req.query.module}`);
  // ... use dynamicModule ...
}
```

If `req.query.module` is not available during the build, the import fails during runtime.
